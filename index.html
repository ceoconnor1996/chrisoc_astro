								<b>Planet engulfment events.</b>
								<br>
								Sun-like stars (~1-2 solar mass) will become red giant stars near the end of their lives, swelling more than 100 times in size. 
								During this stage, planets orbiting close to their host stars are likely to be engulfed and destroyed. 
								Depending on the size of the planet, the process of engulfment can have major consequences for the host star's structure and later evolution, 
								and it can produce transient phenomena that we can observe from Earth. 
								The greatest effects occur when a Jupiter-sized gas giant planet is engulfed while the red giant star is close to its maximum physical size.
								<br>
								My collaborators and I have studied the consequences of planet engulfment for red giant stars using the stellar evolution code 
								Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). 
								We found that red giant stars can become significantly brighter over several years after engulfing a gas giant planet; 
								this suggests that wide-field sky surveys, like ZTF and Rubin/LSST, can detect planet engulfment events in action 
								(maybe like <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Natur.617...55D/abstract">this one!</a>). 
								We also found that the most massive planets (5-10x the mass of Jupiter) can cause their stars to produce a bright eruption 
								called a <i>luminous red nova</i>. 
								<br>
								Our paper on this work has been accepted to ApJ. You can read a preprint <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230409882O/abstract">here</a>.

								<b>Dynamical origins of white-dwarf pollution.</b>
								<br>
								More than 1/3 of white-dwarf stars are constantly ingesting debris from tidally disrupted planetary bodies previously
								in orbit around these stellar remnants. This "pollution" offers a unique window into the final stage in the life cycle 
								of a planetary system, particularly from the perspective of long-term dynamical evolution. I am interested in 
								applying dynamical theory to understand the processes by which planetary debris is delivered to a white dwarf.

								<br>
								<i>Why don't we observe white-dwarf pollution from exocomets?</i> (submitted, preprint coming soon)
								<!--
								<br>
								In a recent paper, my co-authors and I studied the origins of pollution in a model planetary system containing an asteroid belt and two outer
								giant planets -- not so different from our own Solar System, if you only include Jupiter, Saturn, and the asteroids! We showed
								gravitational perturbations from the two outer planets tend to build up over very long timescales, eventually leading to a steady
								stream of asteroids impacting the central star (or, in this case, white dwarf). Although our model is rather simplistic, it does 
								surprisingly well in terms of reproducing the observed trend of accretion rate (mass gained per unit time) versus age for polluted
								white dwarfs. Most exciting of all, our model predicts that an <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=1911">upcoming JWST survey</a> 
								for planets around white dwarfs may find multiple planets per system!
								<br>
								Our paper was accepted for publication in MNRAS; a preprint is available on arXiv. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211108716O/abstract">ADS link</a>.

								<b>Tidal interactions and high-e migration in planetary and stellar systems.</b><br>
								Many forms of dynamical evolution in astrophysical systems lead to close encounters between a planet and
								a star or between two stars. At these close distances, tidal forces between the objects lead to a variety of 
								interesting phenomena, ranging from the excitation of a body's internal oscillations -- in essence, making it
								ring like a bell -- to tearing it apart entirely. Nature seems to produce all of these outcomes in different settings.
								I have studied high-eccentricity migration in a few different papers so far, mostly in relation to surviving planetary
								systems around white dwarfs.
